This is a demo project which utilises the TMDB API for fetching a movie based on a random seed title, and using that movie information to fetch the correct movie poster. The aim is to guess all the letters without running out of turns

## Why?

This site was created as a simple application to learn and practice some of Reacts various features. I wanted to create a simple application from scratch as a learning experience that was not following a tutorial and was not another To-Do App.

## What?
### Built Using
* React
* HTML
* Javascript
* CSS Modules
* Conditional Rendering
* Data Fetching from an external API


## To Run Locally

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This site was bootstrapped with Vite
